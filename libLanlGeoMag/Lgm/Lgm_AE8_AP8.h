 *
 *  These are static arrays of the data "MAPS" that are used in the AE8/AP8
 *  radiation belt flux models. This file was computer generated by AE8_Fmt.c
 *  which reads in the raw MAPS used in the fortran code and dumps them in a
 *  more readable format. Note: each array has a leading zero added. This is to
 *  make the arrays compatible with the fortran-stlye arrays starting at index
 *  1 instead, of zero.
