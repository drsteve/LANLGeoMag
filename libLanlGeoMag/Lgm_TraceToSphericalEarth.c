 *
 *     This is a version of Lgm_TraceToEarth, but in this version the Earth is
 *     approximated by a sphere of radius WGS84_A (i.e. the equatorial radius
 *     in the WGS84 model). This is useful for computing magnetic flux of a
 *     drift shell since a spherical surface is much easier to compute B dot dA
 *     on. The magnetic flux doesnt care what surface we use, so using a
 *     spherical earth for that isnt an approximation...
