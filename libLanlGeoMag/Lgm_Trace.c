/**
 *  \brief
 *      This routine attempts to trace to the Earth (from the input position) in both
 *      directions along the field line.  If the field line is closed (meaning
 *      that we hit the Earth in both directions), then the routine will also
 *      trace to the minimum-B point.
 *  
 *  \detail
 *      This is a convenience routine that calls the routines Lgm_TraceToEarth()
 *      and Lgm_TraceToMinBSurf() (and performs some aditional calculations also).
 *      Note that the routine Lgm_TraceToEarth() traces to a height above the WGS84
 *      ellipsoid. Thus the target height here ( the input parameter Height ) is
 *      the geodetic height above the WGS84 ellipsoid. If you want to trace to a
 *      spherical representation of the Earth, use Lgm_TraceToSphericalEarth()
 *      instead.
 *  
 *      \param[in]       u     Input position vector in GSM coordinates.
 *      \param[out]     v1     Southern footpoint (where field line crosses the given geodetic height in the south) in GSM coordinates.
 *      \param[out]     v2     Northern footpoint (where field line crosses the given geodetic height in the north) in GSM coordinates.
 *      \param[out]     v3     Minimum B point along the field line in GSM coordinates.
 *      \param[in]      Height The altitude (in km) above the WGS84 ellispoid (i.e. geodetic height) used to define what we mean by the footpoint altitude.
 *      \param[in]      TOL1   Tolerance for tracing to the Earth.
 *      \param[in]      TOL2   Tolerance for tracing to the Min-B point.
 *      \param[in,out]  Info   Properly initialized/configured Lgm_MagModelInfo structure.
 *  
 *      \return 
 *          - LGM_OPEN_IMF     ( = 0 ) if field line is open at both ends (i.e. an IMF FL). In this case, nonem of the v1, v2, v3 values are valid.
 *          - LGM_CLOSED       ( = 1 ) if field line is closed. In this case all of the v1, v2, v3 are valid.
 *          - LGM_OPEN_N_LOBE  ( = 2 ) if field line is northern lobe FL (v2 valid).
 *          - LGM_OPEN_S_LOBE  ( = 3 ) if field line is southern lobe FL (v1 valid).
 *          - LGM_INSIDE_EARTH ( = -1 ) initial point is inside Earth (no points valid).
 *          - LGM_TARGET_HEIGHT_UNREACHABLE ( = -2 ) field line never got above the target height (no points valid).
 *          - LGM_BAD_TRACE    ( = -3 ) Lgm_MagStep() was unable to make a non-zero step (B-field zero?).
 *
 *
 *  Upon return, the following elements of the Info structure will be set or changed;
 *      - Hmax (maximum step size used for tracing. Not really useful to the user.)
 *      - Pmin. Position of Bmin along the field line. In Re relative to GSM coord system. (Same as v3.)
 *      - Smin. Distance from southern footpoint to Pmin along the FL. (in Re).
 *      - Stotal. Distance from southern footpoint to northern footpoint along the FL. (in Re).
 *      - Snorth. Distance from u to northern footpoint location.
 *      - Ssouth. Distance from u to southern footpoint location.
 *      - Bvecmin. The GSM components of the magnetic field vector at Pmin. Units are nT.
 *      - Bmin. The magnitude of Bvecmin. Units of nT.
 *      - Ellipsoid_Footprint_Pn. GSM position of northern footpoint. (Same as v2.)
 *      - Ellipsoid_Footprint_Bvecn. GSM components of the magnetic field vector at Ellipsoid_Footprint_Pn. Units of nT.
 *      - Ellipsoid_Footprint_Bn. Magnitude of Ellipsoid_Footprint_Bvecn. Units of nT.
 *      - Ellipsoid_Footprint_Ps. GSM position of southern footpoint. (Same as v1.)
 *      - Ellipsoid_Footprint_Bvecs. GSM components of the magnetic field vector at Ellipsoid_Footprint_Ps. Units of nT.
 *      - Ellipsoid_Footprint_Bs. Magnitude of Ellipsoid_Footprint_Bvecs. Units of nT.
 *      - d2B_ds2. Second derivative of B wrt s at Pmin. Units of nT/Re/Re.
 *      - Sb0. Approximation for the Sb integral for nearly equatorially mirroring particles. Units of Re. See eqn 2.13b in Roederer.
