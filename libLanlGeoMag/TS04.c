    /*
     * Notes about Tsyg_TS04():
     *
     *        (1) If the parmod values are not set appropriately, the model can
     *            return bad values. For example, if IMF By and Bz are zero,
     *            the model will return a zero value in the IMF region. This
     *            will screw up FL tracing routines. Also, the model only uses
     *            IMF By and Bz - so if the IMF is purely radial (i.e. all in
     *            Bx), the same problem will occur. I dont know if this ever
     *            occurs in the QinDenton Files -- but its something to watch
     *            out for.
     *
     *        (2) The model separates the final calculations into 3 regions:
     *            (a) INSIDE MAGNETOPAUSE; (b) OUTSIDE MAGNETOPAUSE, BUT INSIDE
     *            a narrow BOUNDARY REGION over which the field transitions to
     *            the IMF field; (c) the IMF region. Across the boundary
     *            region, the model blends the inside field with the IMF field
     *            using the FINT and FEXT factors. At the inner edge of the
     *            boundary, FINT=1, FEXT=0. At the outer edge of the boundary,
     *            FINT=0, FEXT=1. To do the blending properly, it needs to have
     *            the full fields (i.e. B + B_dipole). So in the final calcs,
     *            the model does this sort of thing;
     *
     *                  if ( We are INSIDE ) {
     *
     *                      Bfinal = Bmodel;
     *
     *                  } else if ( We are in BOUNDARY REGION ) {
     *
     *                      Bfinal = (Bmodel + Bdipole) * Fint + Bimf * Fext - Bdipole;
     *
     *                  } else if ( We are in IMF REGION ) {
     *
     *                      Bfinal = Bimf - Bdipole;
     *
     *                  }
     *
     *            Note that the blending is done with the full field (Bmodel +
     *            Bdipole). The dipole field is then subtracted before the
     *            values are returned because Tsyg_TS04() is just supposed to
     *            return the "external field" (i.e. B due to everything but
     *            the internal dipole field).
     *
     *            Why is all of this important? There are two issues: 
     *
     *                  (a) Our choice of internal model is almost certainly
     *                      different from Tsyganenko's and that introduces an
     *                      inconsistency.
     *
     *                  (b) If you somehow run the model with IMF By and Bz =
     *                      0, the differences between Tsyganenko's dipole and ours
     *                      will produce strange residual values in the BOUNDARY
     *                      and IMF regions. You will get very peculiar FLs out there.
     *
     *            To avoid problems, make sure the input params arfe set to
     *            something sane. In addition, I have changed the code so that
     *            the final blending is done here in this code where we have
     *            access to our dipole model.
