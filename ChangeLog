	* configure.ac: releasing version 1.5.16.

	* libLanlGeoMag/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): took the Images
	directory out of this list because it makes the tarball
	distribution too big.

2011-07-08  Mike Henderson <mghenderson@lanl.gov>
    * configure.ac: added LGM_INDEX_DATA_DIR to locate where to find index data (e.g. Kp, Dst, AE). 

2011-04-25  Mark Galassi  <markgalassi@lanl.gov>
	* configure.ac, lanlgeomag.spec.in: started maintaining a .spec.in
	file.

	* NEWS: started this file.

	* HACKING: added a release section.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST),
	libLanlGeoMag/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): now I add the files
	individually instead of putting whole directories.  The problem
	with whole directories is that the .svn directories also got put
	there, which is not good.

	* libLanlGeoMag/dox: removed this directory from source control
	since it is auto-generated.

	* configure.ac: added the DX_INIT_DOXYGEN directives for doxygen.

	* Makefile.am, aminclude.am: added including of aminclude.am which
	has doxygen stuff in it.

	* Makefile.in, */Makefile.in, */*/Makefile.in, configure,
	config.sub, depcomp, aclocal.m4, autoscan, ltmain.sh, install-sh,
	configure, config.guess: removed these files because they are
	auto-generated.

	* HACKING: introduced this file which gives developer
	instructions.

	* configure.ac (LGM_EOP_DATA_DIR), Makefile.am (AM_CPPFLAGS),
	libLanlGeoMag/Makefile.am (AM_CPPFLAGS)
	libLanlGeoMag/Lgm/Makefile.am (AM_CPPFLAGS): new approach to
	compiling-in the LGM_EOP_DATA_DIR -- we use
	-DDATADIR='"$(datadir)"' to get the correct prefix at "make" time,
	and use that DATADIR in the config.h file.

	* libLanlGeoMag/Lgm_CTrans.c: added including of config.h, and put
	a #warning if we have to use the hard-coded LGM_EOP_DATA_DIR.

	* libLanlGeoMag/Lgm_Vec.c: added #include <stlib.h> for calloc()

	* configure.ac: added AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR as suggested by
	autoreconf.

	* Makefile.am (ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS): added this flag.
