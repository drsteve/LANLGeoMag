	* libLanlGeoMag/Makefile.am (pkgconfigdir): changed to be
	$(prefix)/lib/pkgconfig since libdir is sometimes set (for example
	during debian builds) to $(prefix)/lib/x86_64_bla_bla/ and this is
	not OK for the pkgconfig file lgm.pc

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): added README.md -- with this last
	touch "make distcheck" works!

	* libLanlGeoMag/Makefile.am (uninstall-hook): fixed permissions so
	that we can correctly remove these files.

	* configure.ac: made the default to disable perl so that one can
	use make distcheck.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am: adjusted the way doxygen is handled
	so that "make dist" works (it was broken before).  Also added a
	rule to make README from README.md so that the GNU coding
	standards are satisfied.

	* libLanlGeoMag/Makefile.am: took out again the Images/ directory
	because it makes tarballs and RPMs too big (on the order of 300meg
	instead of 50meg).

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): re-added the Images directory that was
	commented out.  This is necessary for a "make install" from the
	tarball to work.

	* lanlgeomag.spec.in: added some Requires and BuildRequires, and
	took out the requirement for Perl since we configure with
	--disable-perl.  Also started using appropriate RPM macros.

	* configure.ac: updated THE_PKG_RELEASE to 7; this affects the RPM
	package release number.

	* Doxyfile: added USE_MATHJAX, the compact latex option, and the
	amsmath package, which is needed for the \text{'} that comes up
	occasionally in the doxygen docs.

	* Doc/LanlGeoMag.tag.in, configure.ac: the LanlGeoMag.tag file was
	required for "make dist" but did not exist.  I have added it,
	built from a .in file so it can have a version number in it.
	Modified configure.ac to generate Doc/LanlGeoMag.tag from
	Doc/LanlGeoMag.tag.in

2017-11-16  Mark Galassi  <markgalassi@lanl.gov>

	* configure.ac: releasing version 1.5.16.

	* lanlgeomag.spec.in: added --disable-perl for building RPMs.

	* libLanlGeoMag/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): took the Images
	directory out of this list because it makes the tarball
	distribution too big.

2018-03-09  Steve Morley <smorley@lanl.gov>
        * Release: v1.5.16

        * tests: revised and expanded test suite, github repo set to use Travis
        CI

        * Lgm_QinDenton: updated defaults, changed handling of missing data
        files

        * Lgm_Ellipsoid: added shapes, intersections, etc.

        * Tools: Command line utils for Magnetic Ephemeris files and Last 
        Closed Drift Shell calculation

        * ViewDriftShell: Updates to improve portability and UI

        * ComputeLstar: Behavior in Shabansky orbits now set by flag in 
        LstarInfo struct

        * Lgm_CTrans: Added JPL DE421 to obtain Sun vector (now have DE, high 
        accuracy and low accuracy)

        * TS07: TS07 magnetic field model fully enabled. Requires coefficient
        files in same location/format as IRBEMlib.

        * Other: More changes since this file was last updated than can be 
        encapsulated here. OSS release and GitHub hosting means that commit 
        history is now publicly available.

2011-07-08  Mike Henderson <mghenderson@lanl.gov>
	* configure.ac: added LGM_INDEX_DATA_DIR to locate where to find
	index data (e.g. Kp, Dst, AE).

2011-04-25  Mark Galassi  <markgalassi@lanl.gov>
	* configure.ac, lanlgeomag.spec.in: started maintaining a .spec.in
	file.

	* NEWS: started this file.

	* HACKING: added a release section.

2010-09-22  Mark Galassi  <markgalassi@lanl.gov>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST),
	libLanlGeoMag/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): now I add the files
	individually instead of putting whole directories.  The problem
	with whole directories is that the .svn directories also got put
	there, which is not good.

2010-08-12  Mark Galassi  <markgalassi@lanl.gov>

	* libLanlGeoMag/dox: removed this directory from source control
	since it is auto-generated.

	* configure.ac: added the DX_INIT_DOXYGEN directives for doxygen.

	* Makefile.am, aminclude.am: added including of aminclude.am which
	has doxygen stuff in it.

	* Makefile.in, */Makefile.in, */*/Makefile.in, configure,
	config.sub, depcomp, aclocal.m4, autoscan, ltmain.sh, install-sh,
	configure, config.guess: removed these files because they are
	auto-generated.

	* HACKING: introduced this file which gives developer
	instructions.

	* configure.ac (LGM_EOP_DATA_DIR), Makefile.am (AM_CPPFLAGS),
	libLanlGeoMag/Makefile.am (AM_CPPFLAGS)
	libLanlGeoMag/Lgm/Makefile.am (AM_CPPFLAGS): new approach to
	compiling-in the LGM_EOP_DATA_DIR -- we use
	-DDATADIR='"$(datadir)"' to get the correct prefix at "make" time,
	and use that DATADIR in the config.h file.

	* libLanlGeoMag/Lgm_CTrans.c: added including of config.h, and put
	a #warning if we have to use the hard-coded LGM_EOP_DATA_DIR.

	* libLanlGeoMag/Lgm_Vec.c: added #include <stlib.h> for calloc()

	* configure.ac: added AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR as suggested by
	autoreconf.

	* Makefile.am (ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS): added this flag.
