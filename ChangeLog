    * Release: v2.0.0-alpha

    * Continuous integration: Migrated to GitHub actions

    * Installation: Perl extension disabled by default (--disable-perl argument removed from configure). To enable perl extension, use --enable-perl

    * IGRF: Updated to DGRF12/IGRF13. Update extrapolation to use secular variation.

    * Lgm_QinDenton: Extra checks in Lgm_QinDenton to reduce unnecessary output and check for inputs with standard QD naming convention ([1min, 5min, hour], in that priority order)

    * New functions: Lgm_Terminator, FluxTubeVolume, Lgm_ReplaceSubString2, Lgm_B_FromScatteredData6 added to library

    * Experimental Gaussian Process Regression functionality added to library

    * Updates to enable second-order evaluation of fist adiabatic invariant

    * magstep: Bulirsch-Stoer relative tolerance set to zero by default (only use absolute error)

    * API change: Add RelaxTolerance argument to FindShellLine

    * API change: Add ErrorStatus to all function variants of ComputeI_FromMltMlat

    * TA16: Tsyganenko-Andreeva 2016 model added. Currently requires TA coeficient input files.

    * TS04: Trap added for clean return if evaluating deep inside Earth

    * JensonCain1960: New internal field model added

    * Bug fixes: Correct altitude for lambda integrand in L* calculation, Correct angle in Lgm_EarthEclipse, Correct intersection calculation for Lgm_Ellipse

    * Other: Preliminary version of field-aligned (PQB) coordinates, expanded KdTree functionality, updates to various examples, tests updated for expected changes, numerous minor documentation updates, etc.


2018-03-09  Steve Morley <smorley@lanl.gov>
    * Release: v1.5.16

    * tests: revised and expanded test suite, github repo set to use Travis
    CI

    * Lgm_QinDenton: updated defaults, changed handling of missing data
    files

    * Lgm_Ellipsoid: added shapes, intersections, etc.

    * Tools: Command line utils for Magnetic Ephemeris files and Last 
    Closed Drift Shell calculation

    * ViewDriftShell: Updates to improve portability and UI

    * ComputeLstar: Behavior in Shabansky orbits now set by flag in 
    LstarInfo struct

    * Lgm_CTrans: Added JPL DE421 to obtain Sun vector (now have DE, high 
    accuracy and low accuracy)

    * TS07: TS07 magnetic field model fully enabled. Requires coefficient
    files in same location/format as IRBEMlib.

    * Other: More changes since this file was last updated than can be 
    encapsulated here. OSS release and GitHub hosting means that commit 
    history is now publicly available.

2011-07-08  Mike Henderson <mghenderson@lanl.gov>
    * configure.ac: added LGM_INDEX_DATA_DIR to locate where to find index data (e.g. Kp, Dst, AE). 

2011-04-25  Mark Galassi  <markgalassi@lanl.gov>
	* configure.ac, lanlgeomag.spec.in: started maintaining a .spec.in
	file.

	* NEWS: started this file.

	* HACKING: added a release section.

2010-09-22  Mark Galassi  <markgalassi@lanl.gov>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST),
	libLanlGeoMag/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): now I add the files
	individually instead of putting whole directories.  The problem
	with whole directories is that the .svn directories also got put
	there, which is not good.

2010-08-12  Mark Galassi  <markgalassi@lanl.gov>

	* libLanlGeoMag/dox: removed this directory from source control
	since it is auto-generated.

	* configure.ac: added the DX_INIT_DOXYGEN directives for doxygen.

	* Makefile.am, aminclude.am: added including of aminclude.am which
	has doxygen stuff in it.

	* Makefile.in, */Makefile.in, */*/Makefile.in, configure,
	config.sub, depcomp, aclocal.m4, autoscan, ltmain.sh, install-sh,
	configure, config.guess: removed these files because they are
	auto-generated.

	* HACKING: introduced this file which gives developer
	instructions.

	* configure.ac (LGM_EOP_DATA_DIR), Makefile.am (AM_CPPFLAGS),
	libLanlGeoMag/Makefile.am (AM_CPPFLAGS)
	libLanlGeoMag/Lgm/Makefile.am (AM_CPPFLAGS): new approach to
	compiling-in the LGM_EOP_DATA_DIR -- we use
	-DDATADIR='"$(datadir)"' to get the correct prefix at "make" time,
	and use that DATADIR in the config.h file.

	* libLanlGeoMag/Lgm_CTrans.c: added including of config.h, and put
	a #warning if we have to use the hard-coded LGM_EOP_DATA_DIR.

	* libLanlGeoMag/Lgm_Vec.c: added #include <stlib.h> for calloc()

	* configure.ac: added AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR as suggested by
	autoreconf.

	* Makefile.am (ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS): added this flag.
