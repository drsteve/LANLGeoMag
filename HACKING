Instructions for developers who use the source code repository
**************************************************************

GIT repository
==============

The source repository can be obtained (read-only) at:
git clone https://github.com/drsteve/LANLGeoMag.git

For write access, fork the repository and clone from your fork.
Further information can be found in the github help.

Then:

cd LanlGeoMag

Later updates:
git pull

Committing your work:

git add [files]
git commit 
git pull
git push

Then send a pull request with your changes.


Prerequisites
=============

The following list may not be complete. It is important to note that the 
dependencies for LanlGeoMag will have their own dependencies (and so on), so we
highly recommend installing the dependencies using a package manager. On Mac
package managers are not installed by default: MacPorts and HomeBrew are 
popular options.

git
autoconf >=2.62 (earlier versions do not have the AC_OPENMP)
libtool >=2.4.2 (earlier versions filter openmp flags - see http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-libtool/2011-03/msg00024.html)
libperl-dev
gsl
hdf5 >= 1.8 (API changed at this release)

On Mac, the following should also be installed through the package manager:
argp-standalone


Compiling
=========

Just once (or just occasionally):

autoreconf -i
./configure

NB (Oct 2015): Recent updates to HDF5 include non-standard locations and use of
pkg-config. If you have problems with HDF5 when running configure, try:

./configure CFLAGS=`pkg-config hdf5 --cflags` LIBS=`pkg-config hdf5 --libs|grep -o '^\S*'`


Every time:

make


Installing
==========
sudo make install

Note: This will run the script GetEopFiles. If you are behind a proxy, you may
need to modify your /etc/sudoers file to include the line;

Defaults env_keep = "http_proxy ftp_proxy" 



Release engineering
===================

Example: you want to freeze and release version 1.5.12.  The
convention is that we use tags with the name v1.5.12

Developer actions
.................

The developer takes these steps:

* Commit all final changes and sure that the code passes "make
  distcheck"

* Set the new version in configure.ac with AC_INIT(... , [1.5.12] , ...)

* Update the NEWS file with a list of user-visible or API changes

* Tag the repository with

git tag -a v1.5.12
git commit -m "tagged release v1.5.12"
git push --tags

* Then move to the "development" version v1.5.12+ by editing
  configure.ac and NEWS and putting AC_INIT(... , [1.5.12] , ...)

Release engineer actions
........................

Start with a fresh clone followed by a checkout of the release tag:

git clone ssh://YOUR_SCHEME_LOGIN@svn.isr.lanl.gov/n/projects/lanl/LanlGeoMag.git LanlGeoMag-v1.5.12
cd LanlGeoMag-v1.5.12
git checkout v1.5.12

autoreconf -i
./configure
make distcheck

And you've got a well-tracked tarball called lanlgeomag-1.5.12.tar.gz

Finally, you can try running

rpmbuild -ta lanlgeomag-1.5.12.tar.gz

to build RPMs.  RPMs are not yet working because we still have
/usr/lanl hard-coded in a lot of places, but we are getting closer.


Ctypesgen
=========
The Python wrappers require ctypesgen. For simplicity, we bundle our own
version from https://github.com/olsonse/ctypesgen

There's a nice discussion at
https://medium.com/@porteneuve/mastering-git-subtrees-943d29a798ec

If you aren't hacking on the ctypes code itself, there's no need to read
any of this. But if you need to update the bundled ctypes, first set up
the repositories:

git remote add ctypesgen https://github.com/olsonse/ctypesgen.git

To start this process from scratch (i.e. before we had anything pulled in):
git fetch ctypesgen
git read-tree --prefix=Python/ctypesgen/ -u ctypesgen/master

But to update ctypesgen now that it's been incorporated:
git fetch ctypesgen
git merge -s subtree --squash ctypesgen/master
git rev-parse ctypesgen/master #To get SHA1
git commit -m "Update ctypesgen to (SHA1)"

We should refer to this license (3-clause BSD) in the lanlgeomag docs.


make dist
===========
It seems you need to make with --enable-doxygen-doc on the ./configure cmd line....
