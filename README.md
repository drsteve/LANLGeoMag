Getting Started with LANLGeoMag
===============================
Clone or download from https://github.com/drsteve/LANLGeoMag

If everything is set up correctly:
```
autoreconf -i
./configure
make -j
make install
```

Also see `./configure --help` for options at configure time, and
additional helpful information can be found in the `HACKING` file.
Autogenerated instructions for Linux are given in `INSTALL`, which
is generated by automake when `autoreconf -i` is run.
Guidance for contributors can be found in WORKFLOW.md.

Dependencies are:

OPTIONAL: LanlGeoMag optionally links against libperl, so you may need perl development headers.
Ubuntu package: libperl-dev

GNU Autoconf, Automake and Libtool
----------------------------------
LanlGeoMag uses GNU autotools to build the configure scripts and makefiles.
On GNU systems these are provided with the operating system. On Mac these were 
provided with XCode prior to version 4.3 (Shipped with OS X).
Mac install: (MacPorts) sudo port --verbose install autoconf automake libtool

On non-GNU systems argp must be installed prior to building LanlGeoMag.
